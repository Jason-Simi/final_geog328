## Description

## Analysis of Results
Through this map and all of the features within it, we can see a clear pattern in regards to which areas the Link stations are situated in. All the neighborhoods with a Link station are considered “lower-income”; the area with the highest aggregate income with a Link station is the station in Capitol Hill, with a capital income of $54,848 per year. The areas with the lowest income and Link stations are Rainier Beach and Othello in south Seattle, with capital incomes of $29,206 and $24,970 per year respectively. Through this analysis, we can conclude that within the city of Seattle, the Link functions as a resource for all residents of the city but is intended as a resource for the lower-income population. Increased accessibility to public transportation can negate any need for a car and can maintain a sense of community and connectivity across the entire city, not isolating any one neighborhood because of socioeconomic status. Similarly, having easy to use and readily available public transportation within a low-income area can increase employment opportunities for low-income residents as they are able to easily get across the city. Having Link stations in a given area can also revitalize lower-income areas as it can boost economic activity within the areas that may not get as much traffic without the public transportation. Geographically, the inner city often has higher populations than the higher income, residential neighborhoods closer to the water, so centering a central public transportation system within higher population neighborhoods can serve to maximize the usability of the Link itself and facilitate the highest possible interconnectivity within different Seattle neighborhoods. 

## Goal
Through this project, we wanted to investigate the relationship between income demographics and Link stations. We had 3 main objectives: evaluate the income distribution of residents in close proximity to stations to find trends and disparities, investigate the accessibility and affordability of different income groups to transportation options, and analyze the influence of Light Rail stations on income levels in nearby neighborhoods and communities.
