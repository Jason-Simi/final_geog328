            <h2>Evaluation of income distribution in proximity to Light Rail stations</h2>
            <p>The integration of light rail stations on lower-income neighborhoods in Seattle, as shown in the chloropleth map, holds a pivotal role in transportation for a massive
                amount of people and helps foster needing communities. We can infer that the placement of the stations is based on the requirements of the city, building stations in 
                areas that need a economic catalyst. This is believed to be performed by enhancing connectivity and accessability to job centers as well as creating foot traffic to 
                local business'.
            </p>
            <p>
            Evaluating the income distribution of the residents in close proximity to the stations begins to show the trends and disparities within our Seattle. The positions of the 
            light rail stations shows a deliberate effort to bridge the gaps in economically challenged areas by reviving travel and opening opporunities.
