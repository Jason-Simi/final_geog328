        <h1>Project Objectives</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Evaluate the income distribution of residents residing in close proximity to these stations to find trends and disparities</li>
            <li>Investigate the accessibility and affordability of different income groups to transportation options within the vicinity of the Light Rail stations</li>
            <li>Analyze the influence of Light Rail stations on income levels in nearby neighborhoods</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            In order to best achieve these objectives, we chose to create an interactive map representing the different capital income levels 
            of each Seattle census tract, overlayed with locations of Link stations for easy comparison. In addition, we created a choropleth map
            as a straightforward representation of Seattle income distribution in areas surrounding Link stations to work as an addendum for our 
            spatial analysis.
